<h1 align="center">JavaScript Practice Repository</h1>

Welcome to my JavaScript Practice Repository! This collection of files contains various snippets and exercises I've completed to hone my JavaScript skills. From fundamental syntax exercises to more complex problems involving asynchronous programming and API usage, this repository records my learning journey. This repository includes a variety of JavaScript practice exercises and projects, each focusing on different aspects of the language. The purpose is to build a strong foundation in JavaScript and explore its more advanced features.
## Getting Started

To explore or run the practice exercises in this repository, you'll need:
